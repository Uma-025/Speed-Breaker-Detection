## Speed Breaker Detection Using YOLOv5

**Overview**
This project focuses on detecting speed breakers in road images and videos using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm.
The aim is to enhance road safety by providing real-time alerts for speed breakers that are often missed by drivers or absent from map data.

**Features**
- Real-time detection of speed breakers using YOLOv5
- Custom dataset and training
- Image input support
- Visualization of detection results with bounding boxes
- Model performance evaluation (precision, recall, mAP)

**Tools & Technologies**
- Python
- YOLOv5
- OpenCV
- Google Colab 

**Workflow**
- Data Collection: Captured/collected road images.
- Training: Trained YOLOv5 model on the dataset.
- Detection: Performed inference on test images.
- Evaluation: Analyzed accuracy and detection performance metrics.

**Results**
- Successfully detected speed breakers in varied lighting and road conditions.
- The model achieved high precision and recall after tuning hyperparameters.
- Demonstrated robust real-time detection using the OpenCV interface.
